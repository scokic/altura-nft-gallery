## Stack

I checked out your website [alturanft.com](https://www.alturanft.com/) and saw that you are using NextJS and TailwindCSS so those are the technologies I used for my project. Next is great for SEO and websites where we need SSR, which is why it's a great choice for this type of app.
For better developer experience I also added TypeScript, React Query, and Zustand. I chose not to use any UI library since that would not show my ability to make UI components myself.
